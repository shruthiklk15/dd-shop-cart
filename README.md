# Drag and drop-shopping-cart
I am creating this project to learn more on drag and drop option using jQuery.

* Assignment project

# Welcome to Shopping cart 
* This project is basically developed to implement the drag and drop option on the products.
* The shopping site consists of a navigation bar with home , login button and a cart.
* Display of all the products will be on the home screen where each product has its unique identity and cost specified. The item is provoided with drag and drop option to add it to the cart easily and also the user can add them with the option "add to cart " . A tooltip is used which provides an extra information about something when the user moves the mouse over an element. 
* Success and warning alert messages to show items added to cart and already in cart respectively.
* I have used the local storage for storing the items inside the cart . Soon after entering the cart you can purchase the products.
